# Key Topics
- Agents - A form of AI that simulates human conversation through a chat interface.
- Utterances - Otherwise known as a user query. These trigger topics based on **intent**.
- Intent - The purpose behind a person's interaction with your conversational system; to be effective, the system should recognize what the user wants and provide content that helps them achieve their goal.
- Variables - A piece of information captured and stored in an agent so it can be used later.
- Entities - An information unit that represents a certain type of a real-world subject, like a phone number, zip code, city, or even a person's name.
- Prompts - Generative AI models from AI Builder and natural language understanding to address specific scenarios for your copilots
- Slot Filling - Related to the use of entities that let an agent acquire and use information more easily by identifying and extracting them from the user query.
- Topics - How an agent conversation progresses.
- Generative Answers - Enables your agent to respond using information from designated knowledge sources, ensuring users receive authoritative, topic-specific answers.
- Generative AI Orchestration - Agent chooses the best tools, knowledge, topics, and other agents to answer user queries, or respond to event triggers.
- Knowledge - Agents use data from Power Platform, Dynamics 365, websites and external systems. Knowledge sources allow your agents to provide relevant information and insights for your customers.
- Tools - Lets your agent connect with external systems and add new abilities, so it can take action based on user requests or events.
- Triggers - You can set up custom agents to automatically trigger actions or start topics when specific events occur. Unlike topic triggers, which need user input, event triggers let your agent act on its own whenever the defined event happens.
- MCP - An open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.
