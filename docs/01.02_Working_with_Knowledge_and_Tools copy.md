# Working with Knowledge and Tools



From Microsoft:
*"In Copilot Studio, knowledge sources work together with generative answers. When knowledge sources are added, agents can use enterprise data from Power Platform, Dynamics 365 data, websites, and external systems. Knowledge sources allow your agents to provide relevant information and insights for your customers."*

# Generative Answering

From Microsoft:
*"Generative answers allow your agent to find and present information from multiple sources, internal or external, without having to create specific topics. Generative answers can be used as primary information sources or as a fallback source when authored topics can't answer a user's query. As a result, you can quickly create and deploy a functional agent. Makers don't need to manually author multiple topics, which might not address all customer questions.

By default, when you create an agent, Copilot Studio automatically creates the Conversational boosting system topic. This topic contains a generative answers node, which allows you to begin utilizing knowledge sources immediately. All knowledge sources that are added at the agent level are added to generative answers node in the Conversational boosting system topic."*

*Generative AI Orchestration is on by default.*

If the website has KB articles or FAQ, depending on how you ask the agent can impact the response. 

## Generative vs Classic
Generative mode gives more options than classic mode. For instance, [public websites can use 25 websites versus 4 for classic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/knowledge-copilot-studio#supported-knowledge-sources).
