# Zero prompt experience
[Zero Prompt Experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/copilot-chat-zpe-guide)
The zero prompt experience helps makers enhance user engagement and streamline interactions at the start of a Copilot chat session. By presenting a zero prompt experience adaptive card at the beginning of a chat session, users receive relevant information and options right away, reducing the need for additional prompts and iterations. The zero prompt experience can be context aware and hence, can be selectively shown for targeted pages.

To set the welcome message, use the **WelcomeMessage** variable.
To set the footer for the topic, use the **Topic.FooterMessage** variable.

## Event Received Trigger
You have to use the "Microsoft.PowerApps.Copilot.RequestZeroPrompt" event which is reserved for ZPE. Set the priority above 99, The priority is important because custom zero prompt experiences need to override the default platform provided ones.


# Adaptive Card 
Adaptive card schema doesn't use double quotes for the property name. This conflicts with what is outputted from the Apdative Card designer.

## Set output variable
**Global.PA_Copilot_ZeroPrompt**
