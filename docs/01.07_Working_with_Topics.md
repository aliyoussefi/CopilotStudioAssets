### Using Dataverse Tools
From what I've found, the filter input for Dataverse cannot be set from within a topic. This is limiting usage of variables and seems to reduce the slot filling functionality. To overcome this, use the standard Connector for Dataverse.

### Using the Dataverse connector in Topics
Use the Concatenate function to build the query. This allows you to add variables as you want and avoid any issues with slot filling.
