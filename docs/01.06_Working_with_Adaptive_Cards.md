# Working with Adaptive Cards


## Notes
ActionSet has to be outside body array. The designer will attempt to put it in the body which won't set the output variables.

Good Example:

```
{
  type: "AdaptiveCard",
  '$schema': "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  version: "1.5",
  body: [
    {
      type: "Input.ChoiceSet",
      label: "Active Customers",
      choices:             
        ForAll(Global.varCustomers,
            {
                title: "Name: " & name,
                value: name
            }
        ),
      placeholder: "Pick a Customer",
      id: "SelectedCustomer"
    }
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "Action.Submit",
      title: "Submit"
    }
  ]
}
```
